"Math Pak II" consists of four programs:

1. SIMEQ - Linear simultaneous equations.
2. GAUSS - Gaussian matrix reduction.
3. MATINV - Matrix inversion.
4. MATMUL - Matrix multiplication.

The function of these programs are:

SIMEQ solves systems of up to 7 linear simultaneous equations for all unknowns. It can also be used to complete a Gaussian reduction of matrices from 2x2 to 7x7.

GAUSS completes a Gaussian reduction of a square matrix from 3x3 to 10x10, displays the reduced matrix, and calculates its determinant.

MATINV calculates the inverse of a square matrix, from 3x3 to 6x6.

MATMUL multiplies an IxJ matrix by a JxK matrix, displaying an IxK matrix as the product. IJ + JK must be less than or equal to 98.
